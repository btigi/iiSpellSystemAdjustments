+) Section 1. About
===================
The Spell System Adjustments Mod (evolved from the Spell Refresh Mod) contains several components to alter various mechanics of spell-casting.

The Spell Refresh components allow the player to regain cast spells without the need to rest. This feature can reduce the requirement to rest (avoiding the ludicrous situation where players rest habitually to regain lost spells). The feature also opens a new way of playing - normal mages (and priests) can be played as a more flexible Sorcerer class, and new tactics are possible, as spells become available mid-way through a battle.
The Spell System Adjustments Mod allows mage spells, priest spells and innate abilities to be treated differently, and allows the player to customise their experience. Spells can be regained as soon as they are cast, or after a user-defined delay.
Spells can be regained only after a successful casting, or they can be regained after any casting, even if it was unsuccessful (e.g. the spell caster was hit while casting, and the spell was interrupted).

There are also components to reward spell-casting classes for exercising their primary ability (casting spells) with XP. Fighters gaining XP for killing creatures is acceptable. Mages gaining XP for killing creatures is more questionable. This component aims to make a little more sense, giving XP for casting spells. Mage and Priest spells are contained in separate components (Priests gaining XP for spell-casting doesn't make as much sense as Mages gaining XP for  spell-casting). The XP per spell cast can be set independently for each spell level, as can the maximum amount of XP per spell (so the player cannot progress to level 40 just by casting Magic Missile a few trillion times in the starting dungeon area).


Note that this mod can seriously affect game play, and that while the spell regain feature technically applies to enemy spell-casters, it would rely upon correct scripting, which or may not be the case in the default game.


+) Section 2. (un)Installation
==============================
The Spell System Adjustments Mod is distributed using the WeiDU distribution package. To install, unzip the iiSpellSystemAdjustments(xx).zip file (where xx represents the version number of the release), to the BG2 main directory. Then run the "Setup-iiSpellSystemAdjustments.exe" file, and follow the on-screen prompts. 

To uninstall re-run the "Setup-iiSpellSystemAdjustments.exe" file, and follow the on-screen prompts, selecting "Uninstall" as required.


+) Section 3. Known Issues
==========================
The mod maks use of the DPLAYER scripts, and therefore requires party AI to be switched on.
A large amount of script blocks are added the the game, which may cause possible slowdowns.
Installing the mod and setting various parameters, uninstalling the mod, and then reinstalling the mod with different parameters may have unexpected results.
