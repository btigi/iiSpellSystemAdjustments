+) Section 1. About
===================
  The Spell Refresh Mod allows the player to regain cast spells without the need to rest. This feature can reduce the requirement to rest (avoiding the ludicrous situation where players rest habitually to regain lost spells). The feature also opens a new way of playing - normal mages (and priests) can be played as a more flexible Sorcerer class, and new tactics are possible, as spells become available mid-way through a battle.

The Spell Refresh Mod allows mage spells and priest spells to be treated differently, and allows the player to customise their experience. Spells can be regained as soon as they are cast, or after a user-defined delay.

Spells can be regained only after a successful casting, or they can be regained after any casting, even if it was unsuccessful (e.g. the spell caster was hit while casting, and the spell was interrupted).


Note that this mod can seriously affect game play, and that while the spell regain feature tecnically applies to enemy spell-casters, it would rely upon correct scripting, which or may not be the case in the default game.
